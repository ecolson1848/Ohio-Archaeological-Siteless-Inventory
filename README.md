## Welcome to the Ohio Archaeological Siteless Inventory!

This webpage is dedicated to recording and documenting archaeological data across the State of Ohio that otherwise would not be added to the Ohio Archaeological Database. These information include artifacts without site specific provenience, but still retain some level of context. Anything that cannot be pinned down to a specific County within the state should not be added to this inventory. This is a place for photographs, measurements, attributes, and other observations related to these data. All artifact photographs must include a scale and at least the county from which it was discovered. The better the context, the more useful the information, so if the artifact can be located within a specific section of a specific township within a county, these are ideal for the siteless inventory. However, if the artifact can be located to a specific "site" or pinpoint location on a map, these data should be added to the Ohio Archaeological Inventory managed by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
